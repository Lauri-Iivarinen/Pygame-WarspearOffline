Art (character models) is generated with AI

https://openart.ai/discovery

Notes
  - Graphics suck, it wasnt the point :)
  - Pathfinding is bad, it needs an algorithm and has none
  - Play area is small but can be increased easily
  
  
TODO
  - More indepth classes such as player movement
  - Scale graphics to window size
  - Pathfinding
  - Combat detection and mob aggro
  - Mob movement (chase player if has aggro) and patrolling
  - Inventory and itemization
  - Mobs and quests drop loot
  - Redesign ability bar
  - Secondary stats (dodge, critical hits etc.)
